Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are pushing the boundaries of AI
capabilities by enabling machines to understand both visual and textual
information. Popular models such as Meta AIâ€™s Llama-3.2â€“11B-Vision, Mistral
AIâ€™s Pixtral-12B and Qwenâ€™s Qwen2-VL-7B can handle tasks like image
captioning, visual question answering, and image-text matching out of the box.

While these pre-trained models are impressive, sometimes you need to fine-tune
them to suit your specific needs. This guide will walk you through how to
fine-tune these powerful VLMs, specifically newly released llama 3.2 vision
model.

# Key Steps in Fine-Tuning a VLM:

  1. Define your use case
  2. Set up the development environment
  3. Prepare the dataset
  4. Fine-tune the VLM using TRL and SFTTrainer
  5. Test the fine-tuned model

Letâ€™s dive into each step in detail.

# 1\. Defining Your Multimodal Use Case

Before fine-tuning any model, you must have a clear understanding of the
problem youâ€™re trying to solve. For VLMs, this typically involves tasks that
integrate visual andâ€¦
